    To succeed today, libraries must master many different roles--some traditionally associated with libraries, some not.
    Their new, multi-faceted missions must be supported with great design, strong amenities, and popular programs. 
    That's a lot to juggle, but when everything works together, libraries become places that anchor community life and bring people together.
    To help libraries fulfill their potential as neighborhood institutions, PPS offers the following strategies as a roadmap to success.
